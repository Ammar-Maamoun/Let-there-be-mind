Wine Quality Prediction with RandomForestRegressor
Overview
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on physicochemical properties using a RandomForestRegressor model. Through rigorous experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we've aimed to construct a model that can accurately predict the quality of wine, contributing to quality assessment and enhancement in winemaking.

Dataset
The dataset, WineQT.csv, comprises 11 physicochemical properties as features and a quality score as the target variable. The goal is to predict the wine quality based on these features, offering insights into how each property influences the final quality rating.

Model and Hyperparameters
After extensive tuning, the RandomForestRegressor demonstrated promising results. The best model was achieved with the following hyperparameters:

Max Depth: None (allowing unlimited tree depth)
Number of Estimators: 200 (the number of trees in the forest)
These parameters were determined to be optimal for our dataset, striking a balance between model complexity and prediction accuracy.

Key Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated based on the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.33178078602620087
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.42960698689956317
R-squared (R2): 0.4561479057264316
While the RÂ² value of 0.456 suggests the model explains around 45.6% of the variance in wine quality, it indicates there's room for further model refinement and exploration of additional features or modeling techniques.

Visualization
Included in this project is a scatter plot visualization comparing the true wine quality values against the predicted values. This visualization aids in understanding the model's accuracy and identifying areas where the model's predictions may diverge from actual quality ratings.
