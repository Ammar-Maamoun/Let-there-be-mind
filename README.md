Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN
Project Overview
This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the binary classification of images into two categories: cats and dogs. Utilizing a tailored CNN architecture and the Cat&dogs image dataset, the model achieved a validation accuracy of 0.7960, showcasing the potential of deep learning in image recognition tasks. A single image prediction test further demonstrates the model's practical applicability by accurately classifying an image as a dog.

Dataset
The dataset comprises numerous images of cats and dogs, split into training and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. The training set images underwent preprocessing, including rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping, to enhance model robustness and generalize better to unseen images.

CNN Architecture
The CNN model includes several layers designed to extract and learn from the spatial hierarchies in images:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation to extract features.
Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and retain essential information.
Flattening to convert pooled feature maps into a single vector.
Fully connected layers to learn non-linear combinations of features.
Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Model Training and Evaluation
The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function. It was trained over 25 epochs, achieving a notable validation accuracy of 0.7960. This performance metric highlights the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between cats and dogs.

Single Image Prediction
A practical test of the model involved predicting the class of a single image, successfully identifying it as a dog. This test underscores the model's potential for real-world applications in image classification.
