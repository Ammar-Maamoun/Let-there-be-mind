Polynomial Regression on Housing Data
Project Overview
This project applies Polynomial Regression to a housing dataset to predict a target variable based on several features. The goal is to understand how well the features can predict the value of the target and to evaluate the performance of the Polynomial Regression model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, housing.csv, comprises multiple features related to housing. The last column represents the target variable we aim to predict.

Methodology
Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.
Modeling: Polynomial Regression is applied, transforming the feature set into a polynomial feature set with a degree of 2. This transformation allows for a non-linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) metrics.
Results
The Polynomial Regression model achieved the following performance metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The script will output this value based on the predictions.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The script will output this value based on the predictions.
R-squared (R²): 0.783, indicating that approximately 78.3% of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
Visualization
The project includes a visualization section that plots the true values against the model's predictions for a selected feature, providing a visual assessment of the model's predictive accuracy.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn
Running the Project
To run this project, ensure you have all the required libraries installed, then execute the script First Regression project.py. Ensure the housing.csv file is in the same directory as the script.
