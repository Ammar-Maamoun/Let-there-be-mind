Survival Prediction of Ship Passengers using Logistic Regression
Project Overview
This project employs Logistic Regression to analyze the SVMtrain.csv dataset, which contains data on the survival of passengers aboard a ship. By achieving an accuracy score of 0.7685393258426966, the project aims to uncover insights into factors influencing passenger survival, demonstrating the potential of logistic regression in binary classification tasks within historical or event-based datasets.

SVMtrain Dataset
The SVMtrain.csv dataset is a collection of passenger data from a ship incident, aimed at predicting survival outcomes. It features several predictors, including gender (encoded as 0 for females and 1 for males), among other significant factors. The dataset's primary goal is to model the probability of survival for each passenger based on these features.

Objectives
To predict the survival outcome (survived or not survived) for passengers based on available predictors.
To assess the predictive capability of Logistic Regression in a historical dataset context.
Model Development and Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to encode categorical variables and is split into a 50% training set and a 50% testing set for model evaluation.
Model Training: Logistic Regression is selected for its binary classification strength and ease of interpretation.
Model Evaluation: The model's effectiveness is measured using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.
Key Outcomes
Accuracy Score: 0.7685393258426966, reflecting the model's moderate success in predicting survival outcomes.
Confusion Matrix: Offers insight into the true positive and negative rates, alongside false positives and negatives, showcasing the model's detailed performance.
Execution Instructions
Install Python and necessary libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn).
Obtain the SVMtrain.csv dataset and the Seventh__Training_project.py script.
Execute the script to train the Logistic Regression model and evaluate its accuracy.
Contributions
We encourage contributions that aim to refine the model's accuracy, introduce novel preprocessing techniques, or test different predictive algorithms. Fork this project, implement your changes, and suggest improvements through pull requests.
