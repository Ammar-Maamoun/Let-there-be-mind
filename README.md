Yahoo Stock Movement Prediction using LSTM Networks
Project Overview
This project aims to leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the movement of Yahoo's stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.9575070821529745, demonstrating the potential of LSTM networks in financial market prediction. The project encapsulates the preprocessing of stock data, the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction, and the development of an LSTM-based predictive model.

Dataset
The yahoo_stock.csv dataset comprises historical stock prices for Yahoo, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. This project focuses on predicting the closing price movement based on past price sequences, highlighting how deep learning can be utilized for time series forecasting in finance.

Model Development and Insights
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes normalization and sequencing to prepare for LSTM training. PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information.
LSTM Network Architecture: The model consists of LSTM layers followed by a dense output layer, designed to capture long-term dependencies in time series data.
Training and Validation: The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss, trained over 100 epochs, and validated against a test set to ensure accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Key Results
Accuracy: 0.9575070821529745, indicating high predictive performance in forecasting stock price movements.
Mean Squared Error: Evaluated to quantify the difference between the predicted stock movements and actual movements, further assessing model precision.
