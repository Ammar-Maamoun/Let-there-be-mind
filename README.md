NLP Web Application with Flask and spaCy
Project Overview
This project introduces a web-based NLP application powered by Flask and spaCy, designed to perform fundamental NLP tasks, including tokenization, POS tagging, and NER, on user-provided text. The application serves as an interactive platform for users to analyze text and gain insights into its grammatical structure and the entities it mentions.

Application Features
Tokenization: Breaks down text into individual tokens, providing a foundation for most NLP tasks.
POS Tagging: Assigns grammatical categories to each token, aiding in understanding sentence structure.
Named Entity Recognition: Identifies and classifies named entities within the text into predefined categories, such as names, locations, and organizations.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML for the webpage layout, styled with CSS.
Backend: Flask as the web framework for handling requests and serving the NLP application.
NLP Engine: spaCy for conducting NLP tasks due to its efficiency and accuracy.
Running the Application
Ensure you have Python installed along with Flask and spaCy. Use pip to install any missing dependencies.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing app.py and run it using python app.py. This starts the Flask server.
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5012 (or the port you've configured) to access the application.
Input text into the form and click "Process" to view the NLP analyses.
Development and Deployment
The application was developed with extensibility in mind. Developers can enhance its capabilities by integrating more complex NLP tasks or improving the user interface for a better experience. Deployment options include services like Heroku, AWS, or GCP for broader accessibility.

Contributions
Contributions to extend the application's functionality, improve user experience, or optimize the backend processing are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.
