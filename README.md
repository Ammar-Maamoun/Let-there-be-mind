Energy Efficiency Prediction with Random Forest Regression
Introduction
This repository houses the "Energy Efficiency Prediction with Random Forest Regression" project, leveraging the ENB2012_data.csv dataset. Our focus is on predicting two critical energy efficiency metrics of buildings from various structural and environmental features. With an exceptional R² value of 0.977, our model demonstrates near-perfect predictive accuracy, underscoring the potential of Random Forest in complex regression tasks.

Dataset
The ENB2012_data.csv dataset is an amalgamation of several building parameters potentially affecting energy efficiency, including physical characteristics and external conditions. It aims to predict two target variables representing energy efficiency outcomes, making it a pertinent choice for exploring advanced regression techniques.

Model Overview
The project employs a Random Forest Regression approach, renowned for its efficacy in handling nonlinear data and complex interactions between features. By ensemble learning through numerous decision trees, Random Forest provides a robust and generalizable model, as evidenced by the high R² value achieved.

Key Results
R-squared (R²): 0.977, indicating that our model explains 97.7% of the variability in the target variables, showcasing exceptional predictability.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) & Mean Absolute Error (MAE): These metrics further validate the model's accuracy and precision in predictions.
Visualization
The repository includes plots comparing the true values against the model's predictions for both target variables. These visualizations clearly depict the high degree of accuracy achieved by the model.
