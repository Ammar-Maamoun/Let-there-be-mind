Bank Marketing Outcome Prediction using Random Forest
Project Overview
This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict the success of bank marketing campaigns, based on data from the bank.csv dataset. The goal is to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, aiding in the optimization of marketing strategies. With an accuracy of 0.8974358974358975, the model showcases the efficacy of Random Forest in handling categorical and numerical data for predictive analytics in marketing.

Dataset
The bank.csv dataset includes details on bank clients and their response to marketing campaigns. Features encompass job type, marital status, education, default history, housing, loan status, and contact information, among others. The target variable is the client's subscription to a term deposit (yes/no).

Model Development and Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: Features were encoded using LabelEncoder, and missing data handling was considered to ensure model compatibility.
Random Forest Classifier: Chosen for its ability to manage both categorical and numerical data effectively, improving prediction accuracy and handling overfitting.
Evaluation: The model was assessed using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, validating its predictive capability.
Key Results
Accuracy Score: 0.8974358974358975, indicating high reliability in predicting marketing campaign outcomes.
Confusion Matrix: Offers insight into the true positive and negative rates, supporting the model's performance evaluation.
How to Run the Project
Ensure Python and necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn) are installed.
Download the bank.csv dataset and bank_marketing_prediction.py script.
Execute the script to preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance.
Contributions
Contributions to improve the model's accuracy, explore different preprocessing methods, or experiment with other classifiers are welcome. Fork this project, apply your enhancements, and submit a pull request for review.
