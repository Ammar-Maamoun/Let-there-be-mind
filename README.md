Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
Project Overview
This project utilizes Logistic Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Achieving an accuracy score of 0.8246753246753247, the model provides a solid foundation for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in healthcare analytics.

Dataset
The diabetes.csv dataset comprises several diagnostic measurements, including but not limited to glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, and BMI. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of diabetes.

Model and Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Categorical variables are encoded as necessary.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the dataset. This algorithm is chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and the accuracy score.
Key Metrics
Accuracy Score: 0.8246753246753247
Confusion Matrix: Detailed output available in the project's code, providing insights into the model's true positive and true negative rates.
