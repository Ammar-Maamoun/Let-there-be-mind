Breast Cancer Type Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze the brca.csv dataset, which contains data related to breast cancer patients. The aim is to distinguish between two types of breast cancer, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in enhancing diagnostic processes. With an accuracy score of 0.9300699300699301, the model exhibits high efficacy in classifying cancer types, contributing valuable insights to oncological research and patient care.

BRCA Dataset
The brca.csv dataset comprises features derived from digital images of fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. These features include characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images, such as texture, smoothness, and symmetry. The dataset's primary objective is to classify observations into one of two categories of breast cancer, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning process.

Model Development and Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: Involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and encoding categorical variables where necessary.
Model Training: Utilizes Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to model the relationship between the features and the cancer type.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, among other metrics.
Key Outcomes
Accuracy Score: 0.9300699300699301, indicating a high level of precision in cancer type classification.
Confusion Matrix: Provides detailed insights into the model's predictive accuracy, including its sensitivity and specificity.
Running the Project
Ensure the installation of Python and relevant libraries (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn).
Download the brca.csv dataset and either eighth _training _project.py or Second breast cancer project.py script.
Execute the chosen script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its accuracy.
Contributions
We invite contributions to improve the model's accuracy further, explore alternative algorithms, or enhance the preprocessing pipeline. Fork this project, implement your modifications, and submit a pull request for review.
