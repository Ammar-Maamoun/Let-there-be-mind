Iris Species Classification using Logistic Regression
Introduction
This project applies Logistic Regression to classify iris species based on the famous Iris dataset. Achieving an unprecedented accuracy score of 1.0, this model demonstrates the power of simple yet effective machine learning techniques in handling classification tasks with high-dimensional, multiclass datasets.

Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic in the field of machine learning, comprising 150 instances across three species of iris (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica), with four features measured for each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our model predicts the species based on these four features.

Model Implementation
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The species labels are encoded numerically to fit the logistic regression model.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression classifier is trained on the dataset.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, achieving perfect classification accuracy.
Accuracy Score: 1.0
These results indicate that the model correctly classified every instance in the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of logistic regression for this dataset.

Visualization
Included in the project is a scatter plot visualization comparing the true labels against the model's predictions, illustrating the perfect alignment between predicted and actual values.

Project Structure
